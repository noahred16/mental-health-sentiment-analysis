# For the demo, we'll probably want to save our trained models and just load them in here.

# We should try to make it so that we all use the same evaluation metrics and format.
# So our methods should make sure to accept the data as parameters for training and testing.
# Because we'll want to make sure that we use the same 80/20 split.
# Alternatively we could use a random seed for reproducibility to ensure consistent results.

# We also hopefully can benefit from sharing the same data preprocessing functions.

# We can print out the results of each method here.
